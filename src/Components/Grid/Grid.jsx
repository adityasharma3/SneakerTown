            "The Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 38 Shield is a daily trainer which is
            perfect for keeping your feet dry and warm in damp conditions. The
            Shield version has a thicker, water repellent upper and a modified
            outsole which makes it ride slightly firmer than the regular Pegasus
            38. "

            ‚Äú The Air Zoom Alphafly Next Nature is a fast and natural-feeling
            super shoe which has exceptional versatility but comes with a hefty
            price tag. This Nature version of the Alphafly is partly made with
            recycled material. It has a firmer midsole so it has a faster ride
            but its upper is more relaxed so it has a lower level of foot
            lockdown. ‚Äù

            ‚Äú The Nike Air Zoom Rival Fly 3 is an old school, lightweight tempo
            trainer with a flexible forefoot and a natural ride. It's best
            suited to short, speed workouts but it can also handle long
            distances. Version 3 of the Rival Fly has been updated with a softer
            Cushlon midsole and a thicker, more comfortable upper which makes it
            a better daily trainer. ‚Äù
